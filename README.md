manual testing is  a software testing approch where testers manually evaluate software or application  qualssity without the hellp of automated testing tools or test scripts
testers interact with the system like how an end user would to identify buge, defects,and issuess in the software that create friction in user experience
when a developer manually runs their application and thier out the features they have coded, they are doing manual testing . 
its simplicity makes manual testing great for small scale testing of personal projects.even for large scale testing where there are thousands and millions of items and features to test,
manual testing is still needed to some degree.

benefits of testing-
1) high level accuracy
2) real user experience
3) flexibility in testing process
4) cost effective for small projects
5) no need for complex tools
6) better understanding of customer needs
7) identifying visual issues

   drawbacks of manual testing-
   1)manual testing requires more time or more resources,sometimes both time and resources
   2)performance testing is impractical in manual testing
   3)comparing a large amount of data is impractical
   4)processing change requests during software maintenance takes more time
   5)batch testing is possible , but for each test execution human user interaction is mandatory
